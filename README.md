# Wordle clone - word guessing game

First project I made that is not part of a course, curriculum etc. 

I enjoy playing Wordle, but found it lame that you can only play once a day.

So, instead of playing other versions, I made my own clone.

Built with: 
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Thanks to RazorSh4rk's [Random Word API](https://github.com/RazorSh4rk/random-word-api) for random words.
